# DNA Sequencing with Machine Learning

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook designed to introduce high school students to Machine Learning concepts through a practical example: **DNA sequencing**. 

## ðŸ§¬ What is DNA Sequencing?
DNA sequencing is the process of determining the exact order of nucleotides (A, T, C, G) in a DNA molecule. Scientists use sequencing to study genes, detect diseases, and understand how life works at a molecular level.

## ðŸ¤– How Can Machine Learning Help?
Machine Learning (ML) allows us to recognize patterns in DNA sequences, helping in tasks like identifying genetic mutations or classifying organisms. In this notebook, we break down the problem into simple steps that anyone can follow, even without prior programming experience!

## ðŸ“š What You Will Learn
In this notebook, we explore:
1. **Data Analysis**: Understanding DNA sequences and preparing them for machine learning.
2. **K-mer Counting**: Splitting DNA sequences into smaller overlapping pieces (k-mers) for feature extraction.
3. **Bag-of-Words (BoW) Representation**: Converting DNA sequences into a numerical format that a machine learning model can understand.
4. **Model Training & Validation**: Using the **Hold-Out Method** to test our model's performance.

## ðŸš€ How to Use the Notebook
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alessandroquirile/SequencingDNA.git
   ```
2. Install the required python dependencies:
    ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/dna-sequencing.ipynb
   ```

## ðŸŽ¯ Who Is This For?
- **High school students** curious about science and technology.
- **Beginners in programming** who want a hands-on introduction to machine learning.
- **Anyone interested in bioinformatics** and its real-world applications.
- _The explanations are written in a **simplified and accessible language** to ensure that students with no prior knowledge of programming or machine learning can follow along easily._

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Project?
This notebook was created as an educational tool to **make Machine Learning accessible** to students with no prior programming knowledge. The explanations use simple, intuitive language to guide learners through the process step by step.
